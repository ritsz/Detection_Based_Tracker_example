An example for using the new tracking algorithms available with OpenCV 2.4.
Here I am using the Detection Based Tracker ( found in the contrib header) .
The method uses haar cascade. It is much faster than Haar but not as robust.

I am not entirely sure but I think OpenCV2.4 or above is required.
DetectionBasedTracker class is a derivative of Algorithm class (a new data structure)
that has started from OpenCV 2.4 onwards.

Just compile and run. No extra inputs required.
